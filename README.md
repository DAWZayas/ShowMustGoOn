<a href=https://showgoon.firebaseapp.com/>got to app</a>

This app it is going to be a seeker of concerts, in relation with your preferences and zones.

The content will be:
Users registration where we will collect the following information:
User name and last name
User age
User email
User city and how far (in km.) are they able to travel to a concert
User musical preferences, where they will be able to choose between:
rock
pop
reggae
ska
classic
heavy
rap
romantic
metal
reggaeton 
Connect to facebook (optional)(in this case we only ask the last two points)
Users homepage where we will show the concerts that match the information we have gathered in the registration
Every concert will have his own page with the information:
Price
Place
Still tickets available?
Link to buy tickets
Button to confirm you are going to the concert
Once you confirmed your assistance we will ask if you want us to connect you with other users that are going to the concert so you can go together
News page, where we will comment concerts cancellations, new artist songs and many others news related with music and concerts
Users concert choosed, where we will show the concerts the users already choosed,
	and if they wanted us to connect them to other users, there will be under the concert 	name a list of users we suggested to go (names and age). Once clicked a user we 	suggested, there will be a pop-up where you can email him/her.

This description is what we want the app to be once we finish, but at the beginning we are thinking about a much simple app where we will just:
Show a first homepage where you can choose one from different types of music and will link you to the following page.
Once in there, there will be a list of concerts. For example: Marea - Madrid
When you choosed a concert we will show the info about it, and ask you if you are going to assist, and if you want us to connect you to other people.
If you want us to connect you with other people we will ask your name and email so we can do it
